# Contributing to the Secure Pipeline Workshop ðŸš€

##  What We're Looking For

- **New Security Tools**: Found a cool OSS security scanner? Share it!
- **Documentation**: Improve clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness
- **Bug Fixes**: If something's broken, please fix it (our users will thank you)
- **Workshop Improvements**: Better explanations, more hands-on examples

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Proprietary tools (this is OSS-land)
- Breaking changes without good reason
- Removing security features (that would be ironic)
- Adding complexity just for the sake of it

## Code Style

- Keep it simple, silly (KISS principle)
- Make workflows readable
- Follow existing patterns
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.) - it makes our commit history look professional!

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Security issue? Something confusing?

1. Check if it's already reported
2. Create a detailed issue
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Add relevant logs/screenshots
5. Be nice (we're all learning here)

## Please Be Patient

This workshop is currently maintained by just two people in their spare time. We appreciate your contributions and will review them as soon as we can, but please be patient with our response times. Your understanding helps us keep this project sustainable!

Happy hacking! ðŸŽ‰
