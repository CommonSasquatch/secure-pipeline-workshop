# Code of Conduct for the Secure Pipeline Workshop ðŸš¦

## 1. Be kind (or at least, don't be a troll)
- No insults, no discrimination, no bad vibes.
- Remember: behind every commit is a person (or a bot, but that counts too).

## 2. Respect ideas
- All questions are valid (yes, even the one you think is silly).
- If you disagree, debate with arguments, not personal attacks.

## 3. No malicious spoilers
- Don't publish real vulnerabilities without warning first.
- Don't share secrets, passwords, or the ending of your favorite show.

## 4. Fun and learning for everyone
- This is a safe space to learn and make mistakes.
- If you see someone lost, lend a hand!

## 5. Report bad behavior
- If you see something out of place, let the organizers know.
- We reserve the right to ban anyone who doesn't respect these rules (and to put cat memes on their PRs).

---

**In short:**
Be a good person, share, learn, and help make the community as secure as the pipeline we want to build.

Thanks for making this workshop an awesome place! ðŸ˜Ž
